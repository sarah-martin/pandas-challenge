Data Analysis

There seems to be a negative correlation to school size and overall passing grade, meaning students are less likely to get higher grades with an increased number of classmates.

Charter school students have the highest chance of obtaining higher grades, likely due to the smaller class sizes.

There is not a positive correlation between budget per student and overall passing percentage.
